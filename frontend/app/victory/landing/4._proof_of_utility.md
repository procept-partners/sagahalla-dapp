# Token Minting and Proof of Utility

## How Token Minting in SagaHalla Aligns with Real-World Project Contributions

SagaHalla’s token minting process is distinctively designed around the Proof of Utility (PoU) mechanism, which ties token issuance directly to real-world contributions and project achievements. This approach ensures that tokens have value beyond market speculation, reflecting the actual utility generated by cooperative members through both financial and labor contributions and the fair value perceived from the community tied to the transparency of the token system.

### Proof of Utility (PoU): Core Mechanism

1. **Utility-Backed Token Issuance**
   - Tokens within SagaHalla are pre-minted on a fixed 21-round schedule, supporting a scarcity model similar to Bitcoin.
   - The primary community token, **FYRE (ERC20)**, and the labor input token, **mana (ERC20)**, are minted in sync with one another.
   - These tokens are pre-minted according to a specified start date and time established by governance and held by the treasury until required for circulation.
   - Fundraising targets align with the minting schedule to fully collateralize FYRE and **MANA (ERC1400)** tokens for each round according to a collateralization ratio set by governance.
   - **Only fully collateralized FYRE tokens** are used to purchase fully collateralized MANA tokens, stabilizing financial contributions and maintaining the specified contribution ratio between the community and cooperative members.

2. **mana Token Flow**
   - **mana (ERC20)**: Used operationally by the cooperative for managing labor contributions to projects. These tokens are allocated to project budgets based on projected labor efforts, ensuring that utility is assessed fairly and validated by stakeholders.
   - **mana (ERC1400)**: Created when a member contributes their mana (ERC20) to the cooperative. This requires KYC and holding a SHLD token to verify cooperative identity.
   - **MANA (ERC1400)**: Represents Bitcoin-backed financial contributions, offering full governance rights and supporting stable value.

3. **Transparent Blockchain-Driven Utility Valuation**
   - Real-time logging of contributions ensures that both labor and financial inputs are transparently recorded throughout each project’s lifecycle. This system supports SagaHalla’s commitment to accountability within a blockchain-based, transparent framework.

4. **Agile Project Management and Token Reconciliation**
   - Tokens are distributed to team members upon meeting project milestones. Unutilized tokens return to the treasury for reallocation, ensuring resources are efficiently managed.

### Minting and Burning Rules

- **Minting of FYRE and mana (ERC20)**: Minted on a fixed schedule to ensure labor inputs are appropriately allocated without speculative influence.
- **Minting of mana (ERC1400)**: Minted in proportion to demand for labor contributions, granting governance rights to SHLD holders based on value.
- **Minting of MANA (ERC1400)**: Minted based on demand for Bitcoin-backed financial contributions, collateralized for governance stability.

### Balancing Financial and Labor Contributions

SagaHalla’s dual-token governance model ensures that both capital and labor contributions are appropriately valued and that the approved governance ratio of members to active investors is maintained. By separating financial contributions (MANA) from labor-driven utility (mana), the cooperative maintains a balanced economy that promotes active engagement and discourages passive speculation.
