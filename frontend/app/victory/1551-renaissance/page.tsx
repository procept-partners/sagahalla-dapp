            The 1551 Renaissance: An Evolutionary Token System and Journey of Discovery

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
            A Cooperative Token Economy Rooted in Purpose
          </h2>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            At the outset, our approach to designing SagaHalla’s token system was pragmatic. We aimed to create a model that could 
            sustainably balance the needs of members, investors, and the community—reflecting a cooperative spirit similar to Bitcoin’s 
            principles of decentralization. As we refined our model, we encountered unexpected yet profound alignments with historical 
            governance milestones, natural principles, and even elements of fate.

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
            Exploring the Token Economy Design Space
          </h2>

          <h3 className="sub-section-header text-2xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">The 15% Threshold Discovery</h3>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            We began by setting clear parameters. SagaHalla had to remain member-controlled, so we established that members must hold 
            at least 51% of the contribution ratio. But as we sought to include community and investor contributions without compromising 
            this control, we discovered an optimal ratio: 51% for members, 15% for community capital, and 34% for investors. This 
            combination was not only practical but felt inherently balanced—a natural harmony between member control, community trust, 
            and investor growth.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Golden Ratio: A Universal Balance</h2>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            The golden ratio, known for its natural symmetry, has inspired balance in some of the world’s most renowned structures. 
            Remarkably, the member-to-community ratio of 51:15 closely mirrors twice the golden ratio, situating investors at a natural 
            midpoint that aligns with this universal balance and supports both community and member interests.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">21,000 Contribution Units: A Nod to Bitcoin’s Vision</h2>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            Inspired by this balance and Bitcoin’s decentralized vision, we set SagaHalla’s total contribution units at 21,000, or 0.1% 
            of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. This intentional alignment highlights SagaHalla’s commitment to broad participation and 
            decentralized governance, connecting our cooperative to principles that have guided the global blockchain movement.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Historical Alignment: 510 and 340</h2>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            When dividing these units across 21 rounds—another nod to Bitcoin’s approach of spreading engagement across time—we arrived 
            at 510 units for members and 340 for investors per round. Intriguingly, these numbers align with pivotal moments in history:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-5">
            <li><strong>510 BCE</strong>: The founding of the Roman Republic, a governance shift toward shared responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>340 BCE</strong>: An era in Greece of political experimentation, where elite citizens contributed to the first 
            representative government.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            These historical parallels with significant governance milestones in Western history reinforce that SagaHalla’s structure 
            embodies an evolution of timeless governance ideals, combining sustainability and democratic influence with economic 
            empowerment for individuals.
          </p>

          <h2 className="section-header text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The 1551 Renaissance™: A New Era of Cooperative Governance</h2>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            This carefully balanced design has culminated in what we call the <strong>1551 Renaissance™</strong>. The year 1551 symbolizes 
            a rebirth of knowledge and governance, marking events like the founding of the University of San Marcos, the oldest university 
            in the Americas. It represents a cultural awakening—much like the resurgence of decentralized systems today. SagaHalla’s 51% 
            member control and 15% community backing embody a governance model that unites ancient wisdom with modern technology, offering 
            a new path forward that champions cooperative integrity over centralized control.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph leading-relaxed">
            Our design process began with practical goals but ultimately led to a system that resonates with history, natural laws, and 
            principles of fate. SagaHalla’s token system reflects balance and beauty—where numbers, governance ideals, and cooperative 
            principles converge to create something extraordinary.
